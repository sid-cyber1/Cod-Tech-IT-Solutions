task-1. Smart Watering System:
o Description: Build a system that automatically waters plants based on soil moisture
levels.
o Setup: Use a Raspberry Pi, a moisture sensor, a pump, and a breadboard. Use
Python programming to read the sensor data, control the pump, and create a web
interface for monitoring and manual watering.
o Virtual Setup Platform: Cloud9 or Google Colab with Python libraries like RPi.GPIO
and Flask.
task-2. Automatic Room Light Control:
o Description: Build a system that adjusts the brightness of room lights based on
ambient light level and user preferences.
o Setup: Use an Arduino Uno, a light sensor, an LED strip, and a potentiometer.
Develop Arduino code to read the sensor data, control the LED brightness, and
accept user input from the potentiometer.
o Virtual Setup Platform: Tinkercad with the Arduino simulator and breadboard
simulation.

task-3. Environmental Monitoring Station:
o Description: Build a station that records and displays temperature, humidity, and
pressure data.
o Setup: Use a micro:bit, a temperature/humidity sensor, a pressure sensor, and an
LED display. Write micro:bit code to read the sensors, calculate dew point, and
display the data on the LED screen.
o Virtual Setup Platform: MakeCode for micro:bit with drag-and-drop programming
blocks.
